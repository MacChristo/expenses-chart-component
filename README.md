## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've done quite a few JavaScript project now for beginners. It's still pretty hard for me though but I getting on quite well. I will continue to take on more project to polish  my JS skills. I have now progressed to taking on `Junior Level` JS project. It was easy and interesting to make. This project taught me how to work with `JSON` data and how to work with date and time modules.

### Continued development

I'm now in `Junior Level` in javascript. I will continue to forge ahead and complete more projects until I become confident in my Javascript abilities.
